# OpenCV Learning Projects
This repository contains my practice code as I learn OpenCV — a powerful open-source library for computer vision. I’m currently following tutorials by [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim), and using this space to apply what I’ve learned through small projects, experiments, and exercises. 
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of image processing, real-time video analysis, and fundamental computer vision techniques.
